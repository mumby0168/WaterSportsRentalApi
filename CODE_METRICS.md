## Metric definitions

  - **Maintainability index**: Measures ease of code maintenance. Higher values are better.
  - **Cyclomatic complexity**: Measures the number of branches. Lower values are better.
  - **Depth of inheritance**: Measures length of object inheritance hierarchy. Lower values are better.
  - **Class coupling**: Measures the number of classes that are referenced. Lower values are better.
  - **Lines of source code**: Exact number of lines of source code. Lower values are better.
  - **Lines of executable code**: Approximates the lines of executable code. Lower values are better.
